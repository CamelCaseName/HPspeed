# HPspeed
### a mod to create a better speedrunning experience for House Party
---
## 1. Installation
To use this, you need [melonloader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation) and [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/downloads/), as well as the .dll files from the latest [release](https://github.com/CamelCaseName/HPspeed/releases).

Install melonlaoder for House Party in the newest Version (4.x) and LiveSplit. 
Then start House party once and let melonloader do its things. 
After it has finished, you can close the game again. Place the "HPspeed.dll" in melonloader's Mods folder, 
and the "HPspeedComponent.dll" in Livesplits Component folder. 
You can then start LiveSplit, and add the "HPspeed" Component to your Layout.
You may also now start the game again. The order in which you start the game and LiveSplit does not matter.

## 2. Running with it

To run with it, add the "HPspeed" component to your LiveSplit Layout. 
Now, as soon as you are in House Party and move for the first time, the timer will start. 
The timer is synchronized to the in game one, so any type of pause will also pause the speedrunning timer.

You must (should) select the Category in the Layout settings. 
This defines when the run will be stopped. Now you just need to create a fitting split, and you are done.

Happy running!
